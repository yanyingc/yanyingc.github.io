        <h2>Recent Proejects</h2>
        <h3>Medical Image Report Generation, 2018 - present, at FXPAL</h3>
        <p class="pub">
        Adapted context-aware image to text generation to medical domains. Proposed the model that addressed the data bias problems in medical image reports and the need of higher accuracy on the descriptions of abnormalities. Lead the research and communication with collaborators.
        </p>        
        
        <h3>Business Activity/Location Recognition and Image/Video Captioning, 2015 - 2018, at FXPAL</h3>
        <p class="pub">
        Leveraged deep learning technologies for identifying business venues and customer purchase stage from social media images and posts, and generating image descriptions relevant to business activities therein. Designed models that integrate context cross domains/tasks to improve and enrich image/video description generation.  
        </p>

        <h3>Viewer Affective Comment Generation, 2013 - 2014, at Columbia University</h3>
        <p class="pub">
        Leveraged visual and text sentiment analysis to discover the relations between image content 
	and the evoked viewer affects in its comments and learn an affective comment generator for social media images.
